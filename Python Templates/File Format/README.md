## File Format Plugin

At the moment, this plugin provides font export functionality through the export dialog.
Planned for the future are Save and Open functionalities.

This sample plugin is functional and exports glyph names, unicodes and glyph width into a simple CSV file.
It makes use of a GUI. See the description one level up (https://github.com/schriftgestalt/GlyphsSDK/tree/master/Python%20Templates) on how to use them.
